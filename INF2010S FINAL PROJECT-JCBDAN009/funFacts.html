<h1>Facts about Computer Security</h1>

<ul>

<li>Having a strong password actually can prevent most attacks

<h6>Facebook’s Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos has spent most of his career finding security vulnerabilities and figuring out how attackers might try to exploit software flaws. He’s seen everything from the most devious hacks to the simplest social engineering scams. And in all that time, he’s found that there are two simple solutions for the vast majority of users: strong passwords and two-factor authentication.Stamos says that the biggest problem is that the media focuses on stories about the deepest and most complicated hacks, leaving users feeling like there’s nothing they can do to defend themselves. But that’s just not true. </h6>
<li>Just because a device is new does not mean it’s safe.
<h6>When you unwrap the box on your new phone, tablet or laptop, it smells like fresh plastic and the batteries work like a dream. But that doesn’t mean your computer isn’t already infected with malware and riddled with security vulnerabilities.I heard this from many of the security experts I interviewed. Eleanor Saitta is the technical director for the International Modern Media Institute, and has worked for over a decade advising governments and corporations about computer security issues. She believes that one of the most pernicious myths about security is that devices begin their lives completely safe, but become less secure as time goes on. That’s simply not true, especially when so many devices come with vulnerable adware like Superfish pre-installed on them (if you recall, Superfish came pre-installed on many Lenovo laptop models)The other issue, which erupted in the media earlier this year with the FREAK attack, is that many machines come pre-installed with backdoors. These are baked in by governmentrequest, to make it easier for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to track adversaries. But unfortunately, backdoors are also security vulnerabilities that anyone can take advantage of. :</h6>
<li>Even the very best software has security vulnerabilities.
<h6>Many of us imagine that sufficiently good software and networks can be completely safe. Because of this attitude, many users get angry when the machines or services they use turn out to be vulnerable to attack. After all, if we can design a safe car, why not a safe phone? Isn’t it just a matter of getting the tech and science right?But Parisa Tabriz told me via email that you can’t look at information security that way. Tabriz is the engineer who heads Google’s Chrome security team, and she believes that information security is more like medicine — a bit of art and science — rather than pure science. That’s because our technology was built by humans, and is being exploited by humans with very unscientific motivations. </h6>
<li> Every website and app should use HTTPS.
<h6>You’ve heard every rumor there is to hear about HTTPS. It’s slow. It’s only for websites that need to be ultra-secure. It doesn’t really work. All wrong. The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Peter Eckersley is a technologist who has been researching the use of HTTPS for several years, and working on the EFF’s HTTPS Everywhere project. He says that there’s a dangerous misconception that many websites and apps don’t need HTTPS. </h6>
<li>The cloud is not safe — it just creates new security problems.
<h6>Everything is cloud these days. You keep your email there, along with your photos, your IMs, your medical records, your bank documents, and even your sex life. And it’s actually safer there than you might think. But it creates new security problems you might not have thought about.</h6>
<li>Software updates are crucial for your protection.
<h6>There are few things more annoying in life than the little pop-up that reminds you that updates are required. Often you have to plug your device in, and the updates can take a really long time. But they are often the only thing that stands between you and being owned up by a bad guy.</h6>
<li>Hackers are not criminals.
<h6>Despite decades of evidence to the contrary, most people think of hackers as the evil adversaries who want nothing more than to steal their digital goods. But hackers can wear white hats as well as black ones — and the white hats break into systems in order to get there before the bad guys do. Once the vulnerabilities have been identified by hackers, they can be patched.</h6>
<li>Cyberattacks and cyberterrorism are exceedingly rare.
<h6>Your biggest threat is somebody breaking into your accounts because you have a crappy password. But that doesn’t stop people from freaking out with fear over “cyberattacks” that are deadly. Ablon says that these kinds of attacks are incredibly unlikely.Basically, many people fear cyberattacks for the same reason they fear serial killers. They are the scariest possible threat. But they are also the least likely.As for cyberterrorism, Ablon writes simply, “Cyberterrorism (to date) does not exist ... what is attributed to cyberterrorism today, is more akin to hacktivism, e.g., gaining access to CENTCOM’s Twitter feed and posting ISIS propaganda.”</h6>
<li>Darknet and Deepweb are not the same thing.
<h6>The Deepweb refers to part of the Internet, specifically the world wide web (so anything that starts www) that isn’t indexed by search engines, so can’t be accessed by Google. The Darknet refers to non-”www” networks, where users may need separate software to access them. For example, Silk Road and many illicit markets are hosted on [Darknet] networks like I2P and Tor.</h6>
